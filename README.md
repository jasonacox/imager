# Imager

> An open-source text-to-image generator built with diffusion models and transformers

Imager is a modular, research-focused generative AI framework for creating high-quality images from text prompts. Built on the foundation of diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and transformer architectures, it provides a transparent, customizable alternative to proprietary text-to-image systems.

## Overview

Imager combines:
- **Transformer encoder** for text understanding (CLIP, T5, or custom language models)
- **UNet-based diffusion decoder** for iterative image generation through denoising
- **Modular architecture** enabling flexible experimentation and research

### Key Features

- **Text Encoders**: Support for pretrained and fine-tuned models
- **Flexible Diffusion**: Guided and unguided sampling strategies
- **Custom Noise Schedules**: Configurable denoising processes
- **Multi-Resolution**: Standard and super-resolution image generation
- **Training Pipeline**: From-scratch training and fine-tuning capabilities

## Project Objectives

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)
- [ ] Implement core diffusion model architecture (UNet)
- [ ] Integrate text encoder (starting with CLIP)
- [ ] Create basic training pipeline
- [ ] Establish evaluation metrics and benchmarks

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- [ ] Add support for multiple text encoders (T5, custom models)
- [ ] Implement advanced sampling strategies (DDIM, DPM-Solver)
- [ ] Create web interface for interactive generation
- [ ] Optimize inference speed and memory usage

### Phase 3: Research & Extension
- [ ] Support for custom dataset training
- [ ] Multi-modal conditioning (text + sketch, text + image)
- [ ] Advanced techniques (ControlNet, LoRA fine-tuning)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and tutorials

## Use Cases

- **Creative Applications**: Art generation, design prototyping, storytelling
- **Research**: Multimodal learning, representation studies, generative modeling
- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic dataset creation for ML pipelines
- **Education**: Understanding modern generative AI architectures

## Why Imager?

Unlike proprietary models, Imager prioritizes:
- **Transparency**: Full access to model architecture and training code
- **Customizability**: Easy modification for specific domains or research needs  
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic results and version-controlled experiments
- **Community**: Open collaboration for advancing generative AI research

Perfect for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to understand, modify, and extend text-to-image generation systems.
